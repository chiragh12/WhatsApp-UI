The WhatsApp Clone App is a simple Flutter application that mimics the basic functionality of the WhatsApp messaging app. It provides a user interface with tabs for Groups, Chats, Status, and Calls.





## Getting Started

```

## How the App work
The WhatsApp Clone App provides a user interface similar to the WhatsApp messaging app. The main screen displays a custom app bar with the WhatsApp logo and title. The app bar includes action icons for camera, search, and more options. The app bar also contains a tab bar with four tabs: Groups, Chats, Status, and Calls.

### Groups Tab
The "Groups" tab is a placeholder and does not include any specific functionality or data.

### Chats Tab
The "Chats" tab displays a list of chat conversations. Each chat conversation includes the name of the contact, the last message sent or received, and the time of the last message. The list is populated with ten sample chat conversations.

### Status Tab
The "Status" tab displays the user's status and recent status updates from other contacts. The user's status is a custom tile with the title "My Status" and a message to tap to add a status update. Below the user's status, there is a section for recent updates, which includes the contact name and the time of the status update. The list is populated with two sample status updates.

### Calls Tab
The "Calls" tab displays a list of recent call history. Each call history item includes the contact name, call type (voice call or video call), and the time of the call. The list is populated with ten sample call history items.
